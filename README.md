Music-Filename-Changer
======================

A simple Perl script that changes the filenames of your music files.  Affects MP3 and MP4 files.

This is useful if you've stripped the music from your iPod (you're allowed to do that, right?) and you get the junky file names like AKJSL23J.mp3 or something.  It takes in the file's metadata and renames it to the form of "SongTitle - Artist - Album.mp3," so make sure that the metadata for your songs is available, otherwise it just fills the void with a space.

Upon running the script you put in the directory you want it to dig into and voila, your music files are organized and readable by filename.
